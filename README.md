Then right-click the .ZIP, and click Extract All.

Afterwards, you're good to run the executable (.exe) file that's in the folder!

This program does the following:
- Creates a text file with three lines of text
- Prints out the text file's contents
- Creates three contacts that each contain a unique name, email address, and ID number.
- Creates a contacts folder and stores three text files with all of the contents of the contacts
- Clears out the contacts' contents, then takes the data from the text files to get the contacts back
- Prints out the contacts
